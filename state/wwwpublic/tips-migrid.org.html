        <p>
          Did you know that you can test-drive the new modernized MiGrid user
          interface?
          You can easily switch between the traditional and the new web
          interface by changing User Interface from V2 to V3 or vice versa
          on your <a href="settings.py" target="_blank">Settings</a>.

        <h4 class="staticpage">2-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h4>
        <p>
          Do you worry about your MiGrid account security? MiGrid provides optional
          2FA on all services to significantly reduce the risk of account abuse
          even if someone gets hold of your password. Due to general security
          considerations and in particular the recent increase in phishing
          attacks we recommend enabling it if you haven't already done so. It's
          done by going through the little
          <a href="setup.py?topic=twofactor" target="_blank">2-Factor Auth Setup</a> 
          wizard.

          Are you aware of the
          <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/" target="_blank">
            FAIR principles</a> and did you know that MiGrid helps you publish
          your research in line with those principles? When you create freeze
          <a href="freezedb.py" target="_blank">Archives</a> on MiGrid you
          have the option of connecting a DOI through the UCPH DOI minting
          service so that you get a convenient and standardized data reference
          for your article and help make the data findable, accessible,
          interoperable and reusable, which is increasingly becoming a common
          requirement when applying for funding.
          Please refer to our FAQ and the user guide for more details.

        <h4 class="staticpage">Custom Start Page</h4>
        <p>
          Do you mainly use e.g. Files when on MiGrid web?
          In your <a href="settings.py" target="_blank">Settings</a> you can
          select another MiGrid Default Page to always go directly there
          when you log in. Thus, saving a bit of time and effort choosing it
          from the default Home every time.

        <p>
          Are you aware that MiGrid integrates basic web hosting for VGrids
          e.g. to present your research and projects?
          When you create a <a href="vgridman.py" target="_blank">VGrid</a>
          on MiGrid it automatically comes with a fully public and a
          participant-only web space where you can make your own web
          pages. Please refer to the user guide for further details.

        <h4 class="staticpage">Easy Data Exchange</h4>
        <p>
          Do you sometimes need to exchange files with people not on MiGrid?
          You can easily do so by right clicking a folder in your MiGrid Files and
          selecting Share Link and Create. Then choose Read Access and/or Write
          Access depending on whether you want the link recipient to download or
          upload files in the selected folder. Anyone you send or hand the link
          to can access the data without the need to have an MiGrid account.
          Please refer to the user guide for further details.

        <h4 class="staticpage">MiGrid as a Network Drive</h4>
        <p>
          Have you ever wanted to use your MiGrid files seamlessly from your
          local programs?
          If you set up SFTP or WebDAVS access on your MiGrid 
          <a href="setup.py?topic=sftp" target="_blank">SFTP Setup</a> or
          <a href="setup.py?topic=webdavs" target="_blank">WebDAVS Setup</a> you
          can in fact do just that. Depending on platform and personal
          preferences you can pick either of the two access methods and
          map/mount your MiGrid home on your computer to interact with the files
          and folders there like any local data.
          Please refer to the user guide for further details.

        <h4 class="staticpage">Easy data Analysis and Presentation</h4>
        <p>
          Why worry about having the right tools for your data analysis and
          presentation on you own computer?
          In a lot of cases you can just use MiGrid and the integrated 
          <a href="jupyter.py" target="_blank">Jupyter DAG/MODI services</a>
          to do a many such tasks directly on your MiGrid data, without the need
          to maintain special-purpose programs locally. In teaching or workshop
          situations this also comes in handy, because it removes the hassle for
          students/participants to install and setup needed applications in the
          required versions. With Jupyter they just need a computer and an MiGrid
          account.
          Please refer to the user guide for further details.

        <p>
          Do you miss the synchronization features from Dropbox and similar to
          keep your documents and small to medium data sets synchronized across
          multiple computers?
          MiGrid offers an instance of the Seafile service, which you can use to
          achieve that. Even better this means that the data remains safe on
          UCPH premises like your ordinary MiGrid data. Seafile additionally comes
          with a number of sharing, collaboration and encryption features
          built-in. To get going you need to first follow the interactive
          <a href="setup.py?topic=seafile" target="_blank">Seafile Setup</a>
          guide.
