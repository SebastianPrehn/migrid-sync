MPI Oriented Development and Investigation or MODI provides a cluster of 8 compute nodes that can be utilized for long running batch jobs. <br/>
The system is configured as a SLURM cluster in which regular slurm commands can be utilized.<br/>
This includes functionality such as 'sbatch', 'squeue', 'sinfo' and friends. <br/><br/>

The current setup does not at the moment support interactive functionalities
such as 'srun' and similar.<br/><br/>

Please refer to the separate 
<a href="/public/MODI-user-guide.pdf" target=_blank>MODI user guide</a> for
details about using MODI. In particular the part about running 'sbatch' commands
using the shared modi mount directory is important for jobs to succeed.
