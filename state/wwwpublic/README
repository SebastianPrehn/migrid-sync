This directory is for public files on migrid sites and all files are visible in
the root on the plain HTTP virtual host and through /public/ on the HTTPS
virtual hosts.

For UI V3 support in About, Support and Status popups on user pages it is
necessary to add about-snippet.html, faq-snippet.html and
quickstart-snippet.html files or symlinks to the sample site files with a
similar prefix.

In order to support the standard security reporting framework 
https://securitytxt.org/
one should also add a security.txt file in the .well-known/ folder or symlink
it to one of the existing site specific files there.

The letsencrypt symlink and the .well-known/acme-challenge are used for the
optional LetsEncrypt certificate setup.

The monitor, archives and public vgrid files should automatically be included here.
